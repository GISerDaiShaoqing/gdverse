* To clarify the note `Number of updates in past 6 months: 9`: Since the submission of the previous version (gdverse 1.3-1) on December 14, 2024, several bugs have accumulated. This version includes some improvements and additional support. While the frequency of submitting updates to CRAN has decreased in recent months, multiple submissions during earlier iterations have resulted in the current note. Moving forward, I will ensure a more appropriate update frequency. Thank you.
